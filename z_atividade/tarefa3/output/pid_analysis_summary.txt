# PID Distribution Analysis

## Overview

This analysis examines the distribution of Process IDs (PIDs) across different experiments and process types. Our goal is to determine whether the distribution of PIDs remains consistent across different repetitions of the experiments.

NOTE: This analysis was performed on a limited sample of log files to avoid memory issues.

## Methodology

We analyzed the PIDs of child (C) and grandchild (G) processes for experiments B, C, and D across a sample of log files. For each experiment and process type, we calculated:

1. The distribution of PIDs (visualized as histograms)
2. Basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max, count)
3. Coefficient of Variation (CV) for each log file
4. CV of CVs to measure consistency across log files

## Key Findings

1. PIDs generally increase sequentially across experiments, reflecting their creation order
2. The variance (measured by CV) tends to be similar across log files for the same experiment
3. The distribution patterns remain consistent between repetitions

## Conclusion

The analysis confirms that the PID distribution does not significantly change across repetitions in different log files. This consistency suggests that the process creation behavior is deterministic and reproducible.

The similarity in variance across log files supports the hypothesis that the experimental conditions remain stable across repetitions, providing a reliable foundation for analyzing process behavior, particularly with respect to orphaned processes.

For a more comprehensive analysis with the full dataset, see the results of simple_pid_analysis.py which processes all log files but does not generate memory-intensive visualizations.

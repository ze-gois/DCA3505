# Process Hierarchy and Orphan Analysis

## Experiment Descriptions

- **Experiment B**: Experiment B - Sem espera (Child sleep: 0ms, Grandchild sleep: 0ms)
- **Experiment C**: Experiment B - Pai espera (Child sleep: 100ms, Grandchild sleep: 0ms)
- **Experiment D**: Experiment D - Neto órfãos (Child sleep: 0ms, Grandchild sleep: 100ms)

## Orphaned Process Analysis

- **Experiment B**: 984 orphaned grandchildren out of 12000 (8.2%)
- **Experiment C**: 220 orphaned grandchildren out of 6000 (3.7%)
- **Experiment D**: 2564 orphaned grandchildren out of 6000 (42.7%)

## Conclusions

Based on the analysis of the log files, we can observe distinct behaviors in each experiment:

- **Experiment B (No Sleep)**: Without explicit sleep, we observed 8.2% orphaned grandchildren. Race conditions can occur but are less predictable.

- **Experiment C (Parent Sleeps)**: When parent processes sleep, we observed 3.7% orphaned grandchildren. The sleep in parent processes introduces timing variability.

- **Experiment D (Grandchild Orphans)**: When grandchildren sleep, we observed 42.7% orphaned grandchildren. This demonstrates how long-running child processes can become orphaned if their parents terminate first.
